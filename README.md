# Exoplanet_Analysis

I have been working with Dr. Trifon Trifonov (MPIA) on multi-planetary systems for three months in 2023, and together we are working to publish a paper for the CARMENES consortium. My primary experience lies in planet detection, where I have analysed radial velocity (RV) and transit data using the Exo-Striker (https://github.com/3fon3fonov/exostriker).

This repository is a collection of code I have created or adapted for the analysis of exoplanets, both regarding RV data and transit data.

If you are going to use any of the code in this Repository, please reference it accordingly!
